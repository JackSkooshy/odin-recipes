        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Is there anything better than a one-skillet
             meal? We don’t think so, particularly if 
             it’s as family-friendly and quick as this
              one, featuring spiced ground beef, flavorful
               rice, hearty beans, and lots of cheese. 
               It all comes together in <strong>just 40 minutes</strong> 
               with minimal prep, and is perfect for when 
               you want to spice things up. </p>
