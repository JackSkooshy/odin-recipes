        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This dish started as way to use leftover rice 
            that has dried out and may not be great on its 
            own, but is still perfectly edible. The addition 
            of oil and soy sauce and veggies and meat spruce 
            up the rice for a delicious meal.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 lb.)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> sesame oil, divided</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> carrots, peeled and diced</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> freshly minced ginger</li>
            <li><strong>4 c.</strong> cooked white rice (preferably leftover)</li>
            <li><strong>3/4 c.</strong> frozen peas</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp.</strong> low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat olive 
                oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper on both 
                sides, then add to skillet, and cook until golden 
                and no longer pink, 8 minutes per side. 
                Remove from skillet and let rest 5 minutes, 
                then cut into bite-sized pieces.
            </li>

            <li>
                To the same skillet, heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil. 
                Add onion and carrots and cook until soft, 5 minutes,
                 Add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, 
                 1 minute more. Stir in rice and peas and cook 
                 until warmed through, 2 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Push rice to one side of skillet and add remaining 
                tablespoon sesame oil to other side. Add egg and 
                stir until almost fully cooked, then fold eggs into 
                rice. Add chicken back to skillet with soy sauce and 
                green onions and stir to combine.
