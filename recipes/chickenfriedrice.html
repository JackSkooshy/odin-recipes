        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This dish started as way to use leftover rice 
            that has dried out and may not be great on its 
            own, but is still perfectly edible. The addition 
            of oil and soy sauce and veggies and meat spruce 
            up the rice for a delicious meal.
